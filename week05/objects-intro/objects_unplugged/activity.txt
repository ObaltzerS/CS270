Objects Example
An object combines data with functions known as methods that operate on the object's data.


FitByte Alice;

Alice.walk(5); // Alice walks 5 miles

Alice.walk(7); // Alice walks 7 more miles

cout << "Total miles walked: " << Alice.getMilesWalked() << endl;

// Assume that we burn 100 calories per mile.
cout << "Total calories burned: " << Alice.getCaloriesBurned() << endl;


Un-plugged Activity

Simulate this object by saying to your neighbor (who is simulating a smart watch/device thingy)

Alice, let's walk 5 miles
let's walk 7 miles
Alice, how far did we walk today?

Switch roles and repeat

What information or data must the fitness watch remember?

What other functions might it have?
