The reason that the total number of comparisons in each test case is 105 is because the number of comparisons is the sum of integers 1 to 14. This is because the number of comparisons (comps) will decrease each iteration through the list by the number of times the list has been iterated through (i). It would be redundant to iterate through the entire list with the bubble sort method for each iteration because we know that the final i + 1 elements of the list are already sorted. As for the total swaps performed, in the optimal test case this is zero while in the worst case it is 105, the same as the number of comparisons performed. The reason that the number of swaps in the worst case is the same as the comparisons is because it will perform a swap on every comparison.
